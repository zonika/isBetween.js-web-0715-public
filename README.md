# Is Between

Your goal is to write a function called `isBetween`. It does exactly you think. The function should take three arguments: `num`, `min`, and `max`. The function should `true` or `false` if num is in between min and max inclusive.

To run the specs follow these commands:
```shell
# first install the new gem to run the tests
gem sources -a http://flatiron:33west26@gems.flatironschool.com
gem install learn-co

# to run in the command line run
learn

#to run in the browser
learn -b
```
